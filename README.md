# CardConnect

NOTE: For now this gem is in a "expiremental phase", we're working an integration with CardConnect, eventually when the core functionality is working and integrated within our systems, we are going to extend this gem and add new capabilities. Please only use it to experiment, and not for production ready projects for now.

```ruby
gem 'card_connect'

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
